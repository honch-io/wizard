/**
 * Task-stream types — wire schema for pushing wizard run state
 * to external consumers (PostHog web app, etc.).
 *
 * The schema is intentionally generic: onboarding is the first consumer,
 * but migrations, audits, and single-task installs can reuse the same
 * transport with a different workflow_id / skill_id pair.
 *
 * Naming note: the backend's public DTO field is `workflow_id` (URL
 * query, regex validation, SSE channel name). The wizard CLI uses
 * "program" terminology internally, so the field is named programId
 * on TaskStreamPush but serialised to `workflow_id` here.
