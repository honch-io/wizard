/**
 * OAuth scope resolver — every program starts from the shared
 * `WIZARD_OAUTH_SCOPES` base set and a program can layer additional
 * scopes on top via `PROGRAM_SCOPE_ADDITIONS`.
 *
 *   final scope set = WIZARD_OAUTH_SCOPES ∪ programAdditions
 *
 * Additions are merged in declaration order and deduped, so a program
 * never accidentally weakens the base set — only widens it. Programs
 * not listed in `PROGRAM_SCOPE_ADDITIONS` request the unchanged
 * base set, exactly like before.
 *
 * Today only `McpTutorial` adds anything: read-only on every product
 * surface (feature flags, experiments, surveys, replays, errors, web
 * analytics, LLM analytics, cohorts, persons) plus read/write on
 * annotations. Persistence writes (dashboard:write, insight:write,
 * notebook:write, query:read) come for free from the base set, so the
 * tutorial's "save as insight / pin to dashboard / add to notebook"
 * follow-ups keep working.
 *
 * Add a new program override by extending `PROGRAM_SCOPE_ADDITIONS`
 * below — no other call-site changes required as long as the program's
 * `programId` is threaded into `getOrAskForProjectData`.

// posthog-integration → ... → setup-utils), and `Program` would be
// read as `undefined` at module init. Keep this type-only and reference
// program IDs by their string-literal value below — TypeScript still
// catches renames via the `Partial<Record<ProgramId, ...>>` keying.

 *   • query:read                                  — HogQL
 *   • dashboard:write, insight:write, notebook:write  — Phase-5 persist
 *
 * Deliberately omitted (writes on read-only product surfaces):
 *   • feature_flag:write, experiment:write, survey:write,
 *     cohort:write, session_recording:write, error_tracking:write,
 *     alert:write, subscription:write
